# Predicting the future performance of soccer players
This repository contains the code and data used for my Master's thesis titled 
"Predicting the future performance of soccer players". The purpose of this thesis 
was to investigate and analyze the impact of various factors on predicting the 
future performance of soccer (football) players using statistical, machine learning, 
and deep learning models. The applied methods demonstrated significantly better 
performance compared to random and naive predictors, providing valuable insights 
into the predictive factors of future soccer player performance.
